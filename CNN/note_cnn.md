# CNN
## Applications
- [WaveNet model](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio).

Why train an A.I. to talk, when you can train it to sing ;)? In April 2017, researchers used a variant of the WaveNet model to generate songs. The original [paper-a-neural-parametric-singing-synthesizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03809) and demo can be found here.

- Facebook's novel CNN approach for language translation that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy at nine times the speed of RNN models.https://engineering.fb.com/ml-applications/a-novel-approach-to-neural-machine-translation/

- Play [Atari games- Human Level Control Through Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://deepmind.com/research/publications/human-level-control-through-deep-reinforcement-learning) with a CNN and reinforcement learning. You can download the [code](https://sites.google.com/a/deepmind.com/dqn/) that comes with this paper.

If you would like to play around with some beginner code (for deep reinforcement learning), you're encouraged to check out Andrej Karpathy's [post](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/).

  - Some of the world's most famous paintings have been t[urned into 3D](https://www.businessinsider.com/3d-printed-works-of-art-for-the-blind-2016-1) for the visually impaired. Although the article does not mention how this was done, we note that it is possible to use a CNN to [predict depth](https://cs.nyu.edu/~deigen/depth/) from a single image.
